Conventions for describing tensors and tensor networks:

- The range of values a single index can take is its <b><u>dimension</u></b>.

- The number of indices of a tensor is its <b><u>order</u></b> (a matrix is an order-2 tensor).

- The tensors making up a tensor network are <b><u>factors</u></b> or <b><u>factor tensors</u></b>.

- For a given tensor network, the contracted indices between factor tensors
  are <b><u>internal indices</u></b>. The uncontracted indices corresponding to the indices
  of the tensor the network represents are <b><u>external indices</u></b>.

- The term <b><u>rank</u></b> refers to the minimum dimension of a factorization of a tensor
  with respect to some bipartition of its indices.
