## Graphical Interfaces and Visualization

* <a href="https://www.tensortrace.com">TensorTrace</a><br/>
  TensorTrace is an application that facilitates the design and 
  implementation of tensor network algorithms. Among many other features,
  TensorTrace can automatically determine the optimal contraction sequence and 
  cost scaling for each network, and generate code (in MATLAB, Python or Julia languages) 
  for contracting the tensor networks numerically.
 
## Open Source Tensor Software

(Listed in alphabetical order by project name.)

* <a href="https://itensor.org">ITensor</a><br/>
  C++ library for tensor networks where matching tensor
  indices automatically contract. Also features MPS and MPO algorithms, such as DMRG, and quantum number block-sparse tensors.

* <a href="https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">QUIMB</a><br/>
  python library for contracting tensors and tensor networks,
  with support for matrix product states and algorithms, and advanced
  features such as determination of the optimal ordering of tensor contractions.\cite{quimb}

* <a href="https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy">TenPy</a><br/>
  Tensor Network Python (TeNPy) is a Python library for the simulation of 
  quantum systems with tensor networks. The philosophy of this library is 
  to get a new balance of a good readability and usability for new-comers, 
  and at the same time powerful algorithms and fast development of new 
  algorithms for experts.\cite{tenpy}

* <a href="http://tensorly.org/">TensorLy</a><br/>
  A python library offering a high-level API for tensor methods and 
  deep tensorized neural networks. TensorLy's backend system allows users to 
  perform computations with NumPy, MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CuPy
  in order to be scalable on both CPU and GPU.\cite{tensorly}

* <a href="https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork">TensorNetwork</a><br/>
  python library for easy and efficient contraction of tensor
  networks, supporting multiple powerful backends

* <a href="http://www.tensortoolbox.org/">Tensor Toolbox</a><br/>
  The Tensor Toolbox is a MATLAB library supporting multiple tensor types, 
  including dense, sparse, and symmetric tensors as well as specially 
  structured tensors, such as Tucker format,
  and others. Tensors can be manipulated using MATLAB's object-oriented features.

* <a href="https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox">TT-Toolbox</a><br/>
  MATLAB implementation of basic operations with tensors in TT-format,
  including TT tensor and TT matrix formats, fast rounding procedures,
  methods for solutions of linear systems and eigenvalue problems,
  and the TT-cross method.

* <a href="http://yingjerkao.github.io/uni10/">Uni10</a><br/>
  Universal Tensor Library, an open-source C++ library designed for 
  the development of tensor network algorithms. Provides a Network class to process 
  and store the details of the graphical representations of the networks,
  and supports quantum number block-sparse tensors.

## Closed-Source Tensor Software

* <a href="https://syten.eu">SyTen</a><br/>
  A symmetry-protected tensor networks toolkit in C++,
  with a set of standard matrix-product state, binary tree-tensor network states 
  and infinite projected entangled pair state utilities included.
