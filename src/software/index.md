## Tensor Software

(Listed in alphabetical order by project name.)

* <a href="https://itensor.org">ITensor</a><br/>
  C++ library for tensor networks where matching tensor
  indices automatically contract. Also features MPS and MPO algorithms, such as DMRG, and quantum number block-sparse tensors.

* <a href="https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">QUIMB</a><br/>
  python library for contracting tensors and tensor networks,
  with support for matrix product states and algorithms, and advanced
  features such as determination of the optimal ordering of tensor contractions.

* <a href="https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork">TensorNetwork</a><br/>
  python library for easy and efficient contraction of tensor
  networks, supporting multiple powerful backends

* <a href="https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox">TT-Toolbox</a><br/>
  MATLAB implementation of basic operations with tensors in TT-format,
  including TT tensor and TT matrix formats, fast rounding procedures,
  methods for solutions of linear systems and eigenvalue problems,
  and the TT-cross method.

* <a href="http://yingjerkao.github.io/uni10/">Uni10</a><br/>
  Universal Tensor Library, an open-source C++ library designed for 
  the development of tensor network algorithms. Provides a Network class to process 
  and store the details of the graphical representations of the networks,
  and supports quantum number block-sparse tensors.
