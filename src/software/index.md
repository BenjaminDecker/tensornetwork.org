## Tensor Software

(Listed in alphabetical order by project name.)

* <a href="https://itensor.org">ITensor</a><br/>
  C++ library for tensor networks where tensor indices
  carry id numbers, allowing automatic contraction of matching tensor
  indices. Also features MPS and MPO algorithms, as well as algorithms
  such as DMRG. Supports quantum number block-sparse tensors too.

* <a href="https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">QUIMB</a><br/>
  python library for contracting tensors and tensor networks,
  with support for matrix product states and algorithms, and advanced
  features such as determination of the optimal ordering of tensor contractions.

* <a href="https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork">TensorNetwork</a><br/>
  python library for easy and efficient contraction of tensor
  networks, supporting multiple powerful backends

* <a href="https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox">TT-Toolbox</a><br/>
  MATLAB implementation of basic operations with tensors in TT-format

* <a href="http://yingjerkao.github.io/uni10/">Uni10</a><br/>
  Universal Tensor Library, an open-source C++ library designed for 
  the development of tensor network algorithms. Provides a Network class to process 
  and store the details of the graphical representations of the networks,
  and supports quantum number block-sparse tensors.
