   **Notes:** C++ library for tensor networks where tensor indices
   carry id numbers, allowing automatic contraction of matching tensor
   indices. Also features MPS and MPO algorithms, as well as algorithms
   such as DMRG. Supports quantum number block-sparse tensors too.

   **Notes:** python library for contracting tensors and tensor networks,
   with support for matrix product states and algorithms, and advanced
   features such as determination of the optimal ordering of tensor contractions.

   **Notes:** python library for easy and efficient contraction of tensor
   networks, supporting multiple powerful backends
