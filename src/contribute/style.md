## Writing Style Guidelines

The goal of the Tensor Network is to be a resource for 
using tensor network methods in _all fields_ of study.
Therefore the majority of pages on the site should use
domain-neutral language. This includes sticking to
the same [[terminology conventions|contribute/conventions]] when
describing tensors and avoiding using jargon or
domain-specific terms such as "entanglement" (used
in quantum physics), except in sections specifically
dedicated to that topic.

Some other tips and guidelines for writing:

- Use a conversational style, preferring words 
  which are understandable to readers with a general
  college undergraduate mathematics background.

- Provide a high level synopsis and concrete examples
  _before_ giving formal specifications.

- Prefer to use [[tensor diagram notation|diagrams]]
  whenever possible.
  A key exception is that when first introducing a topic,
  it is helpful to use traditional tensor notation to
  help readers more familiar with that notation.

- Keep formal or heavy mathematical notation (such as
  set notation) to a minimum except when:

  1. it is helpful for clarifying subtle or formal concepts
  2. it appears within a section explicitly dedicated to 
     rigorous treatments or mathematics literature
