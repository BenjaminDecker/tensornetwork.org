# Contributing Your Tensor Network Expertise

Contributions to the Tensor Network are welcomed, and this 
site is designed with them in mind.

First steps:

1. Create a [https://github.com](Github) account if you do not have one.
2. To edit an existing page via the web, click on the "Edit This Page" link at the bottom.
   Edit the page in the Github browser editor, and commit your changes.
3. To create a new page, visit the 
   [https://github.com/TensorNetwork/tensornetwork.org/tree/master/src](TensorNetwork.org source folder) and click the "Create new file" button in the upper right. New folders can be 
   created by prefixing the new file name with a path description.
4. Once new content is pushed to the tensornetwork.org Github repository, the site will be
   updated within a short time.
