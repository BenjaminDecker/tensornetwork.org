## Applications of Tensor Networks in Probability and Statistics

One of the most common uses of tensor networks is parameterizing
statistical models. For example, a tensor network can compress
the parameters of a generative model in machine learning. Or in 
quantum physics a common use of tensor networks is representing
joint probability distributions of many variables (using the
[[2-norm or Born rule|statistics/2norm_probability]] of probability).
