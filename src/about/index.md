### About the Tensor Network

The Tensor Network is an 
open-source review article focused on tensor network 
algorithms, applications, and software.

Tensor networks are a well developed subject, but many key advances
appear in appendices of specialized papers or obscure preprints,
using domain-specific terminology and notation.
There are excellent review articles which synthesize the tensor network literature, 
but which also have the drawback of being static and representing the
perspective of one group of authors.

Every page of this website is editable, but it is not a wiki per se. 
Instead, it is an "open source website", similar to open source software.
Improvements to the site are managed through Github
([link to Github repository](https://github.com/TensorNetwork/tensornetwork.org))
to ensure quality and so academic contributors can be credited for
their work.
