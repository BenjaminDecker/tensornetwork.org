### About the Tensor Network

The Tensor Network is intended to be an 
open-source review article focused on tensor network 
algorithms, applications, and software.

Tensor networks are already a well developed subject, but many key advances
appear in appendices of specialized papers or in little-known preprints,
typically using domain-specific terminology and notation.
Excellent review articles have been written to synthesize the tensor network literature, 
but these articles have the drawback of being static and representing the
perspective of one group of authors.

Every page of this website is editable, but it is not a wiki per se. 
Instead, it is an "open source website", similar to open source software.
Improvements to the site are managed through Github
([link to Github repository](https://github.com/TensorNetwork/tensornetwork.org))
to ensure quality and so academic contributors can be credited for
their work.
