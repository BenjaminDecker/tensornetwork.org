### About the Tensor Network

The goal of the Tensor Network website is to serve as a community 
review article or textbook focused on tensor network algorithms, applications,
and software.

Tensor networks are already a well developed subject, but many key advances
appear in appendices of specialized papers or in little-known preprints,
typically using domain-specific terminology and notation.
Excellent review articles have been written to synthesize the tensor network literature, 
but these articles have the drawback of being static objects representing the
perspective of one group of authors.

Though every page of this website is editable, it is not a wiki per se. 
Instead, it is an "open source website", similar to open source software.
Improvements to the site are managed through 
[https://github.org/TensorNetwork/tensornetwork.org](Github)
to ensure quality and so academic contributors can be credited for
their work.
