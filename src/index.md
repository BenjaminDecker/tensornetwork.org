### Welcome to the Tensor Network

This site is a resource for tensor network algorithms, theory, and software.

Tensor networks are a technique for factorizing
a many-index tensor into a contracted
network of few-index tensors, and are becoming increasingly
useful for applied mathematics, chemistry, physics, machine
learning, and likely many other fields.
