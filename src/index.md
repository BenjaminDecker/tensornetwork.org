Welcome to the tensor network. This site is a
resource for tensor network algorithms, theory, 
applications, and software.

Tensor networks are a technique for factorizing
a many-index tensor into a contracted
network of few-index tensors, and are very
useful for applied mathematics, physics, machine
learning, and possibly many other fields.
