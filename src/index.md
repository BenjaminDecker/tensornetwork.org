### Welcome to the Tensor Network

<img src="tensor_networks.png" style="float:right; width:40%; margin-left: 40px;"/>

This site is a resource for tensor network algorithms, theory, and software.

Tensor networks are factorizations of very large tensors
into networks of smaller tensors, 
with applications in applied mathematics, chemistry, physics, machine
learning, and many other fields.
