## Applications of Tensor Networks in Quantum Physics

One of the most widely pursued application of tensor networks
is in the approximate solution and modeling of quantum systems,
specifically quantum systems of many particles.
Much of the original literature on tensor networks originates
from this field.

The purpose of this section of TensorNetwork.org is to 
provide background and context on the use of tensor networks
for quantum physics applications, with the intent of helping
new entrants to this field, as well as those using tensor 
networks for other applications but who want to understand
the physics tensor network literature.
