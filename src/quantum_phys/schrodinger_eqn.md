## The Schrodinger Equation of Quantum Mechanics

The Schrodinger equation is the basic defining equation 
of quantum mechanics. It is a partial
differential equation which determines the
of the quantum wavefunction $\Psi$ as a function of time.
The wavefunction parameterizes the probability density
of observing a certain (classical) configuration of
a quantum system in the sense that the 
probability density is the square magnitude of 
the wavefunction. (This correspondence is known as
the Born rule, or 2-norm probability formalism.)

### General Form of the Schrodinger Equation

The Schrodinger equation is

\begin{equation}
i \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi
\end{equation}

where $\hat{H}$ is a linear operator known as the 
Hamiltonian. Typically, $\hat{H}$ is a second-order
differential operator in terms of the spatial coordinates
of a set of quantum particles. Here units are chosen
such that $\hbar=1$.

### Single-particle Schrodinger Equation

Arguably the simplest example of the Schrodinger equation
is the case of a single quantum particle moving in a 
in the presence of a potential $V(\mathbf{r})$. 
For this case, the Schrodinger equation takes the form:

\begin{equation}
i \frac{\partial \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} 
= \Big[\frac{-1}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\Big] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
\end{equation}
