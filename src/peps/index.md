# PEPS Tensor Network 

The PEPS tensor network (_projected entangled pair states_)\cite{Verstraete:2004p,Verstraete:2004r}
generalizes the [[matrix product state / tensor train|mps]] tensor 
network from a one-dimensional network to a network on an arbitrary graph.

The name PEPS comes from a quantum information viewpoint that generic tensor networks
can be viewed as maximally correlated (or entangled) tensors in multiple copies of
the tensor index space which are then projected into a single copy of the index space.

In an more general mathematics context, a better name for these networks might be
tensor grid or tensor lattice networks.

The tensor diagram for a PEPS on a finite square lattice is:
